### Probably not so really important note

This repository is not supported or being updated

Might not be compatible with some hardware

Can be heavy on ram

Some of the code is outdated, awful, unoptimized, or overthought

Tiled was used for maps

In the end, it was never really used much anywhere, and the idea is quite terrible in itself
