### Probably not so really important note

This repository is not supported or being updated

last time tested in july 2024

Tiled was used for maps

Can be heavy on ram

Might not be compatible with some hardware

Some of the code is outdated, awful, unoptimized, or overthought

In the end, it was never really used much anywhere, and the idea is quite stupid in itself
