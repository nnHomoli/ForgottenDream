### Probably not so really important note

[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) was used for maps

Can be heavy on ram

Might not be compatible with some hardware

Some of the code is outdated, awful, unoptimized, unfinished, or overthought

## Setup

-- Install Python [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

-- Set the token of the bot in [config.py](forgotten-dream%2Fconfig.py)
